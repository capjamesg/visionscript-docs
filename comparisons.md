You can use comparison operators to compare two values. This is useful in `If[]` statements, where code inside the statement will only run if the condition evaluates to `True`.

The following comparision operators are available:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `==` | Equal to |
| `!=` | Not equal to |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to
