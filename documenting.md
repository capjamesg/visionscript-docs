While you are writing your VisionScript code, we encourage you to write notes that are relevant to your code. For example, you may want to write why you are using a particular function, or comments that you or another coder may find useful in the future.

To write comments in VisionScript code, start a new line and add a `#` symbol. Then, write your comment.

Here is an example:

```
Load["./garden.jpg"]
# we are detecting in the bottom region because
# the top region does not show the garden
DetectInRegion["bottom"]
Count[]
```

We recommend documenting all of the custom functions you write in your code like this:

```
Make rundetection[]
    # look for cats
    # if a cat is found, save the location of the cat
    # to a CSV file
    Detect["cat"]
    If[Count[] > 0]
        Save["./cats.csv"]
    End
```

## Creating Shareable Documentation

You can use the `vicdocs` tool to generate shareable documentation. This tool will create a HTML document that you can publish with a description of your code.

You will need to install the `vicdocs` tool with `pip`:

```
pip install vicdocs
```

Once you have installed `vicdocs`, you can run it on any `.vic` file:

```
vicdocs program.vic
```

This will create a folder called `program/`, where `program` is the name of your `.vic` file. Inside this folder, you will find a `index.html` file that you can open in your browser.
