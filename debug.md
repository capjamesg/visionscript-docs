</div>

VisionScript features a built-in debugger for understanding how your code works and finding the source of errors.

The debugger triggers when a [Breakpoint[]](/docs/breakpoint) runs in a program. This command stops your code in place and creates an interactive environment in which you can debug.

To debug a program, first add a breakpoint to your script:

```Load["./image.jpg"]
Detect["cat"]
Count[]
Breakpoint[]
Say[]
```
Then, run your program:

```visionscript program.vic
```
When your program reaches the breakpoint, the debugger will trigger.

The debugger looks like this:

```[n,p,q,s,r,h] VisionScript Debug Mode >
```

The letters at the beginning are commands, which mean:

- `n`: Prints the abstract syntax tree for the current line. Run the current line and go to the next one.
- `p`: Go to the previous line.
- `q`: Quit the debugger. This will start running your code until another breakpoint is run, if any. If no breakpoints are run, the program will run to completion.
- `r`: List values in state that you can access.
- `s [state_value]`: Show the value of a state. For example, `s detections_stack` will show the value of the `detections_stack` state.
- `h`: Show help.
